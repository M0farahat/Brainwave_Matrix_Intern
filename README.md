As part of the Brain Wave scholarship program, I completed this sales dashboard as my first Power BI task! ☕📊
The goal was to analyze and visualize coffee shop sales data in a clear and engaging way.

🔍 Dashboard Highlights:
✅ Total sales & orders overview
✅ Monthly & hourly sales trends
✅ Sales distribution by product category & branch
✅ Customer behavior by day of week and hour of day

🖼️ I used a warm, coffee-inspired color palette to match the theme, and focused on both clarity and aesthetics.

🛠️ Tools used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX
